This repository is no longer actively maintained. We appreciate your continued use, but are unable to provide ongoing support, bug fixes, or feature development.

AJA has partnered with the Freedesktop project to provide an upstreamed version of this plugin. You can find documentation and information about the Freedesktop version here: [https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/aja](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/aja).  This is now the recommended source for this plugin.

We recommend caution when using this repository and cannot guarantee stability or compatibility. Thank you for your understanding.

# AJA NTV2 GStreamer

## Overview

This repository contains the AJA NTV2 GStreamer Plugin.  Currently AJA
provides source elements for Uncompressed video (x-raw), HEVC/H.265
Compressed video (x-h265), and uncompressed PCM audio (x-raw S16LE, S32LE).

## Version (tag)

	v1.0.0		initial release

## Requirements

Building the gstreamer plugin requires the AJA NTV2 SDK (enroll as a
developer at www.aja.com) and gstreamer developer library and tools.

The gstreamer plugin supports most AJA Video input boards including
the corvidHEVC.

## Building the plugin

The plugin links with static builds of ajabase and ajantv2.

Build ajabase and ajantv2:

    make -C ajalibraries/ajabase
    make -C ajalibraries/ajantv2

Build the NTV2 GST plugin:

    export GST_NTV2=your_ntv2_sdk_dir
    cd ajaplugins/gstreamer/gst-plugin
    ./autogen.sh
    make
    sudo make install

## Testing the plugin

Follow the instructions included with the SDK to build and install the
AJA driver.

Test the gst plugin:

    export GST_PLUGIN_PATH=/usr/local/lib/gstreamer-1.0
    gst-launch-1.0 ajavideosrc ! videoconvert ! autovideosink

## NVIDIA RDMA Support

This plugin includes optional support for outputting video frames directly
to NVIDIA GPU memory via NVMM buffers using RDMA. Enabling this support
requires the [NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit)
and [DeepStream](https://developer.nvidia.com/deepstream-sdk) to be installed,
and the AJA NTV2 drivers must be compiled with the `AJA_RDMA` flag enabled.

To enable NVMM RDMA support in this plugin, the `GST_CUDA` and `GST_DEEPSTREAM`
environment variables must be set to the CUDA and DeepStream install paths
before running `./autogen.sh` in the build steps above. For example:

    export GST_CUDA=/usr/local/cuda-11.1/targets/sbsa-linux
    export GST_DEEPSTREAM=/opt/nvidia/deepstream/deepstream-5.1

When compiled with NVMM RDMA support, the `nvmm` boolean option is added to the
`ajavideosrc` plugin in order to enable NVMM RDMA buffer outputs. Testing NVMM
RDMA output can be done using the following:

    gst-launch-1.0 ajavideosrc mode=4Kp60-rgba nvmm=true ! nv3dsink

Note that the NVIDIA GStreamer plugins provided by DeepStream do not support
packed YUV formats, and so the use of an RGBA mode is required.
